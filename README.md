_ðŸ”¨ GLox is an interpreter for a toy language "Lox" based on Go._

![](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/Marszs/GLox)

`Lox` is a Turing complete language which combines functional and object-oriented features. **It's a toy language for learning, so it may not be very performant.**

You can find some `Lox` code in `resources/lox` folder.

The interpreter is not fully tested, once I find a bug, it will be fixed as soon as possible.

Usage:
```
cd ./cmd
go build -o glox
./glox -s "source_file_path"
```
