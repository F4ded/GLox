`Lox` is a Turing complete language which combines functional and object-oriented features. **It's a toy language for learning, so it may not be very performant.**

You can find some `Lox` code in `resources/lox` folder.

The interpreter is not fully tested, once I find a bug, I will fix it as soon as possible.

Usage:
```
cd ./cmd
go build -o glox
./glox -s "source_file_path"
```
